# XorString Encryption

XOR encryption is a kind of encryption used to safeguard data. It works by pairing a message (the data you wish to secure) with a secret key (a series of numbers or letters that only you know). This combination produces a coded message that is extremely difficult for anybody else to read or interpret.

This is how it works:

    1-> A unique rule known as the "exclusive OR" (XOR) rule is used to merge the message and the key. According to this rule, if either the message or the key equals 1, the outcome is 1. The result is 0 if both the message and the key are 1. 
    
    2-> The coded message is then delivered to the intended recipient.
    
    3-> The person receiving the message must have the same key that was used to encrypt it in order to decode it. They can then apply the XOR rule to decode and read the message.
    
    Because it is impossible for anyone who does not have the key to decode the message, XOR encryption is a particularly safe approach to protect data. It is often used in computer systems to safeguard sensitive data such as passwords and financial information.
