# XorString
The source code for a semi-complex xor string encryption with additional support for watermarks is available in this git repository. For instance, your key would be available inside of a disassembler like IDA if you used the string "std::string key = "my secure key 123";" in your C++ application, but it would be more difficult if you used a xor string encryption.
