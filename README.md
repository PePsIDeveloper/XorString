# XOR String Encryption

XOR string encryption is a method of protecting data by combining it with a secret key using the "exclusive OR" (XOR) rule. This produces a coded message that is difficult for anyone without the key to interpret.

## How it Works

1.  The message and key are combined using the XOR rule, which states that the result is 1 if either the message or the key is 1, and 0 if both the message and key are 1.
2.  The coded message is then sent to the intended recipient.
3.  The recipient must have the same key used to encrypt the message in order to decode it using the XOR rule.

XOR string encryption is often used in computer systems to protect sensitive data such as passwords and financial information. It is a secure method of data protection because it is difficult for anyone without the key to decode the message.

## Example

Here is an example of what a message might look like when it is not encrypted, and when it is encrypted using XOR string encryption:

-   **Not encrypted:** "pepsi wasn't here yo."
-   **Encrypted:** "AUA0MI313kCU:C"

As you can see, the encrypted message is difficult to interpret without the key.
